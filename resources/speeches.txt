    John's suggestion was just a Band-Aid for the problem.
    The cast on his broken leg was a plaster shackle.
    Laughter is the music of the soul.
    America is a melting pot.
    Her lovely voice was music to his ears.
    The world is a stage.
    My kid's room is a disaster area.
    Life is a rollercoaster.
    Their home was a prison.
    His heart is a cold iron.
    At five o'clock, the interstate is always a parking lot.

    his angry words were bullets to him.
    Your brain is a computer.
    The car was a furnace in the sun.

we have been saying this everyday. I need some more substance out of it. Where is the substance piece. You can say seek the action but what does that really mean.
You and I both know what fake hustle is. We can pretend to go after loose balls and dive on the floor but that doesn't really cut it. You have had the scouting report for several days now. I expected you

You really got to know the plays.
